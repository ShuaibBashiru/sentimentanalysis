,Difference between the true and the mark value of the three resistances,Error in measurement.,Take repeated measurements
1,,,
,,,can be reduced by using the best qualities resistor and galvanometer
2,Inaccuracy occurs in the balance point.,The galvanometer is less sensitive,
,Serious trouble in the measurement of low-value resistance.,thermal effect error,This can also be reduced by connecting the reversing switch between the battery and the bridge.
3,,,
,The resistance of the bridge changes,self-heating of resistance,Can minimized by measuring the resistance within the short time.
4,,,
,,,This error can be reduced by taking the readings severally or by finding the null point.
5,Inaccurate readings,personal error,
